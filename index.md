## [Brioconcept Consulting Inc.](https://brioconcept.com/)

As a consulting company, Brioconcept is doing a lot of different things.

During the 5 years I got to work there I worked mostly on 4 different projects.

### [Personal locator](https://brioconcept.com/portfolio-items/personal-locator/)

This project is a watch that can be used to know the location of the person
wearing it.

It can be used by older or younger people that have a tendency to get lost.

All these watches connect to a server where the whole pool is managed through
a web interface. On that interface you can see the location of the watch but
also get access to fancy features like get an alert if the watch get in or out
of a defined perimeter or if the watch get beyond a configured velocity.

On this project I was in charge on the back-end where the watches would connect
and the front-end where the administrator would manage a pool of watches or the
user would control his watch.

### Patents

[US10453327B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10453327B2) -
Apparatus and methods for geolocating an individual with respect to a perimeter
[2019-10-22]

### [Kontron Canada Inc.](https://www.kontron.com/)

At Brioconcept we did mostly in-house projects for others but sometimes we also
sent engineers for help in other companies.

That's what happened to me when I got to go work at Kontron.

Basically they made a server motherboard for storage server company which
was running what we refered to as the legacy BIOS i.e. the old style,
assembly written one.

![Motherboard](/assets/img/s-l1600 (2).jpg)

At that time the market was slowly moving to the new UEFI BIOS and so they
needed help for the port.

This project got big really quickly and I ended up working on that project for
about 1 year and a half.

I got to do:

* UEFI BIOS development and debugging
* Legacy BIOS development and debugging
* PCIe AER (Advranced Error Reporting) support implementation
* IPMI/BMC development

I also did on site support for this product at the end customer site at
IBM XIV Storage System in Israel.

### Animal feeding device

This project was an inteligent feeding device for animal. The client wanted it
to run Android as the base firmware so he could just hire "of the shelf" app
developper as the device application.

On this project I ported Android to the embedded platform.

### Distech Controls Inc.

Before working at Distech as an employe, I worked there as a consultant.

I first got involved because they wanted to run Android on their new project
and I had experience doing so.

I ended up working there for about 2 years as a consultant before moving as a
full time employe.
