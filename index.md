As a kid I was pretty interested by electronics.

I remember looking at circuit boards coming from things I disassembled and
wondering what all these components were used for.

I got in touch with computers quite early in elementary school. At that time we
had one computer for the whole class. I remember I was a bit afraid to go on it
because our teacher told us we had to power on the screen first and then the
computer or maybe it was the oposite. I've never been too sure of the proper
order and I though I might break something.

Thinking about it now, I not sure if there was in fact some requirement or not.

I got my first contact with the Internet in 6th grades. At that time it was 
still pretty empty.

In the middle of high school, my parents bought our first computers. It was a bit
late compared to most people in my class as I remember a teacher asking to raise
hands to see who had a computer and who hadn't. However we also got the
broadband right away. Basically I skipped the whole dialup thing at home which
was pretty nice.

From there I got my fair share of computer interaction trying to understand the
whole thing.

I'm still working on that.


# Professional experience

Most of my past work has been around taking pieces and making something with
them.

As such, I think it gives me a wider scope but without any deep expertise.

## [Distech Controls Inc.](http://www.distech-controls.com/en/ca/)

I got to work on two Android based products,
[Eclypse](http://www.distech-controls.com/en/ca/products/eclypse/) and 
[Horyzon-C](http://www.distech-controls.com/en/ca/products/displays/).

On these products, I've been involved in quite a few things including:

* Boot sequence
* Hardware configuration
* Network connectivity
* Source code management
* Automated builds

Then I helped in getting the FIPS 140-2 certification. ([line 12](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Validation/Validation-List/SHA-3))

And got to debug some pretty [interresting](https://github.com/qca/open-ath9k-htc-firmware/commit/97217c1250772c3c6dbba8b00bab70df6dbd22da#diff-d89a76e909ac97f43228c098ed8facb3) 
[problems](https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-usb/msg162253.html).

I also took part it this [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170071015A1/en?inventor=francois+gervais&oq=francois+gervais)

## [Brioconcept](https://brioconcept.com/)

I've been mostly involved in making the platform boot and configure the hardware
properly. 

Also quite a bit of my time when on the network connectivity. It may not look
like much but this product is pretty intense that regard as it supports Ethernet,
wifi access point, hotspot, client and some special daisy chain mode on the wifi
client, I think we call it the wifi bridge.





I can remember in early elementary school I think we had one computer for the
whole class

My parent bought our first computer when I was halfway into high school.

Since then I got my fair 

Computer science is quite 

I make things work.

I'm always learning new skills and I love it.

I can't believe I live in a generation of people where you can just design a
plastic case, then have it printed and delivered to you doors. Or order a
couple circuit boards for just a few bucks.  Or get most proof-of-concepts
from 10 lines of python.

The list goes on.






but already, I feel 

I would say I have quite a wide range of technical skills and thats often
helps me to understand the problem and deliver a good solution.
